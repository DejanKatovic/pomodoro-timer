# Overview
Hello!  Thank you for your interest in the FE position at Termly, and congratulations on making it this far.  The final couple of steps of the process are pretty tightly connected.  We ask that you build this project, and it will be the basis for a good portion of the interview.  Just let us know when you're done, then we'll schedule an interview and look over your project.  The first half of the interview will be technical in nature, and we'll spend most of the time talking about your work.

The purpose of the exercise is to get a feel for how you approach writing code and your ability to discuss technical concepts.  We try to be sensitive to your time, so we've tried to pick a project that will allow you to show off a bit without having to invest a lot of effort.  Feel free to really polish an area or two to show your best work, and leave others a bit more rough-and-ready to save time (just be sure indicate which is which in the comments!).  If you don't think you can wrap this up within a week, please reach out -- we try to move quickly, and would hate to have you spend time on this if we're going to be past this stage of the process before you get a chance to finish.

Feel free to approach this project like you do any other project as far as using online resources and the like, but there's little value in the exercise unless the bulk of the work is yours.

# Assignment
Create a Pomodoro timer and a task list to use for completing work. The pomodoro timer will follow the classic pattern of 4 rounds of 25 minutes with a 3-5 minute break and then after 4 rounds a break of 15-30 minutes. Additionally a task list will also be available for tracking the work that needs to be completed.

# Direction
- The Application is a single-user application and information does not need to be shared with anyone else.
- The Developer has full discretion on the user experience and interface.
- The code must be checked in to a public GitHub repository.

# User Story
- As a user, I must be able to easily start the timer.
- As a user, I must be alerted when there is no more time left on the timer.
- As a user, I must be able to view the remaining time of the timer.
- As a user, I must be able to add an item to a todo list.
- As a user, I must be able to complete an item on a todo list.

# Notes
- The app should be built using React.  Feel free to use additional libraries, etc.
- All other decisions are left to the developer -- no need to ask for clarification, just make note of any assumptions or decisions you make.  These make for good discussion items during the interview.
- Be sure to fully implement the story requirements.  Beyond that, please show at least a couple of examples of the other stuff that makes up a successful professional project.  A couple of solid examples plus some stubs or TODOs works great.
